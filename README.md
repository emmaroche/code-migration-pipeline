# Dissertation Code Migration Pipeline

This repository contains the code for my dissertation's code migration pipeline. The pipeline facilitates the migration of code using large language models provided by OpenAI and VertexAI.

## Features

- **Code Migration**: Facilitates migration of code between different programming languages (e.g. Java to Kotlin)
- **OpenAI Model Integration**: Incorporates AI models developed by OpenAI and VertexAI (i.e., GPT-3.5 Turbo, Gemini, PaLM2, and Codey)
- **API Endpoint**: Provides an API to access the code migration functionality
